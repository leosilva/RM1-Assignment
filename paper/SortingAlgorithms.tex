\section{Sorting Algorithms}

This work uses four sorting algorithms: quicksort, mergesort, insertionsort, and bubblesort. In the following subsections, we'll give an overview of them.

\subsection{Quicksort}

Quicksort is an algorithm whose execution time is $\theta(n^2)$ in the worst case over \textit{n} numbers as input. Despite that execution time, quicksort is often the best option for sorting because of its remarkable average efficiency: $\theta(n lg n)$ \cite{Cormen2009}. This algorithm was created by Hoare \cite{}.
